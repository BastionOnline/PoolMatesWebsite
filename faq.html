            <div class="faqQA response">
                <h2>1. How often should I schedule weekly service/vacuum calls?</h2>
                <p>Answer: We recommend scheduling weekly service or vacuum calls throughout the swimming season to maintain optimal water quality and cleanliness. Regular maintenance helps prevent algae growth, ensures balanced chemicals, and keeps your pool in top condition.</p>

            <div class="faqQA response">
                <h2>2. When is the best time to close my pool for the season?</h2>
                <p>Answer: The best time to close your pool is when the water temperature consistently stays below 65°F (18°C). Closing too early can lead to algae growth, while closing too late can risk freezing damage. Late fall is typically ideal, depending on your location.</p>

                <p>Answer: Replacing a pool liner typically takes 1-2 days, depending on the size of your pool and weather conditions. The process involves draining the pool, removing the old liner, installing the new one, and refilling the pool.</p>
