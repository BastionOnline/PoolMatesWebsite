            <div class="faqQA response">
                <h2>1. How often should I schedule weekly service/vacuum calls?</h2>
                <p>Answer: We recommend scheduling weekly service or vacuum calls throughout the swimming season to maintain optimal water quality and cleanliness. Regular maintenance helps prevent algae growth, ensures balanced chemicals, and keeps your pool in top condition.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faqQA response">
                <h2>2. When is the best time to close my pool for the season?</h2>
                <p>Answer: The best time to close your pool is when the water temperature consistently stays below 65°F (18°C). Closing too early can lead to algae growth, while closing too late can risk freezing damage. Late fall is typically ideal, depending on your location.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faqQA response">
                <h2>3. What’s included in your pool opening service?</h2>
                <p>Answer: Our pool opening service includes removing the cover, cleaning the pool, filling it with water, reassembling the filtration system, and balancing the water chemistry. We ensure your pool is ready for a safe and enjoyable season.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faqQA response">
                <h2>4. How do I know if my pool has a leak?</h2>
                <p>Answer: Common signs of a pool leak include unexplained water loss, wet spots around the pool, or increased chemical usage. If you suspect a leak, our leak detection service can accurately locate and repair it to prevent further damage.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faqQA response">
                <h2>5. How long does it take to replace a pool liner?</h2>
                <p>Answer: Replacing a pool liner typically takes 1-2 days, depending on the size of your pool and weather conditions. The process involves draining the pool, removing the old liner, installing the new one, and refilling the pool.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faqQA response">
                <h2>6. Can you service my pool heater?</h2>
                <p>Answer: Yes, our licensed TSSA gas technician can service and repair pool heaters to ensure they operate efficiently. Regular heater maintenance is essential for extending its lifespan and ensuring your pool stays warm when needed.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faqQA response">
                <h2>7. What do I need to do before you install my pool's safety cover?</h2>
                <p>Answer: Before installation, we recommend ensuring the pool area is clean and free of debris. Our team will handle the rest, including measuring and securely installing the safety cover to protect your pool during the off-season.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faqQA response">
                <h2>8. What should I do if my pool equipment malfunctions?</h2>
                <p>Answer: If your pool equipment malfunctions, we recommend turning off the equipment and scheduling a service call as soon as possible. Our technicians will troubleshoot and repair the issue to prevent further damage and ensure your pool runs smoothly.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faqQA response">
                <h2>9. Can I schedule a service while I’m on vacation?</h2>
                <p>Answer: Absolutely! Our vacation vacuum call service ensures your pool is maintained even when you’re away. We’ll keep your pool clean and balanced so that you return to a pristine and ready-to-use pool.</p>
